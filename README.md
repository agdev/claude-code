## Project Overview
Summary of requirements and scope

## Task Summary
- **Total Tasks:** 12
- **Estimated Effort:** 156 hours
- **Complexity Distribution:** 3 High, 5 Medium, 4 Low

## Development Tasks (8 tasks, 112 hours)

### ðŸ”§ **[T001]** User Authentication System (High Priority, 24h)
**Dependencies:** T002 (Database Setup), T003 (Security Config)
**Complexity:** 8/10

Implement secure user authentication with OAuth2 support...

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] OAuth2 Configuration Setup (4h)
- [ ] JWT Token Management (6h)
- [ ] User Registration Flow (8h)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
Core infrastructure and database setup

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
Main functionality implementation

## Next Steps
1. **Start with T002** - Database setup (no dependencies)
2. **Review dependencies** - Ensure logical order
3. **Set up environment** - Development infrastructure

## Relevant Files
- src/auth/oauth.js - OAuth2 implementation âš¡ (To be created)
- tests/auth.test.js - Authentication tests âš¡ (To be created)
```

## Quick Start Example

### 1. Create a test PRD
```markdown
# Chat Application Requirements
Build a real-time chat app with user authentication and channels.

## Core Features
- User registration and authentication
- Real-time messaging with WebSocket
- Chat channels and direct messaging
- Message history and search
```

### 2. Generate tasks from PRD
```bash
/project:prd-to-tasks ./test-prd.md ./chat-tasks
```

### 3. Break down complex tasks
```bash
/project:task-breakdown ./chat-tasks/tasks.json ./detailed-tasks
```

## Advanced Features

### Complexity-Based Breakdown
- Tasks with complexity > 6 automatically generate subtasks
- Intelligent subtask count based on complexity score
- Recursive breakdown for deeply complex requirements

### Domain-Aware Analysis
- **Frontend**: Components, state management, styling, routing
- **Backend**: APIs, authentication, database models, business logic
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E testing
- **DevOps**: Configuration, deployment, monitoring

### Smart Dependency Management
- Automatic dependency inference
- Circular dependency detection and resolution
- Critical path identification
- Parallel execution opportunity detection

### Implementation Sequencing
- Priority-based task ordering
- Dependency-aware scheduling
- Phase-based development planning
- Risk assessment and mitigation

## Command Structure

Both commands are stored as markdown files in `.claude/commands/`:
- `.claude/commands/prd-to-tasks.md` - PRD analysis and task generation
- `.claude/commands/task-breakdown.md` - Task decomposition and breakdown

Each command includes:
- Detailed processing steps
- AI analysis instructions
- Output format specifications
- Error handling procedures
- Quality validation checks

## Integration with Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
```bash
# Convert business requirements to technical tasks

# Break down complex technical tasks
/project:task-breakdown ./project-tasks/tasks.json ./detailed-implementation
```

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Follow generated task sequence
- Use individual task files for implementation guidance
- Update task status as work progresses

### 4. Review Phase
- Validate completed tasks against acceptance criteria
- Use generated test strategies for quality assurance

## Success Criteria

Commands succeed when:
1. **Complete Analysis**: All requirements transformed into actionable tasks
2. **Realistic Estimates**: Time estimates within reasonable accuracy ranges
3. **Clear Dependencies**: Logical implementation sequences established
4. **Quality Standards**: All tasks include acceptance criteria and test strategies
5. **Implementation Ready**: Tasks provide sufficient detail for independent execution

These slash commands provide enterprise-grade project planning capabilities directly within Claude Code, eliminating the need for external task management tools while leveraging Claude's sophisticated AI analysis capabilities.
