## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)
Start with T003 (task ID system) → Define all format specifications → Create templates

**Critical Path:** T003 → T004 → T005 → T006
**Parallel Options:** T007 and T008 can run after T003

### Phase 2: Core Logic (Day 2-3)  
T009 (command creation) → T010 (AI analysis) → T011-T014 (supporting logic)

**Critical Path:** T009 → T010 → T011 → T013
**Parallel Options:** T012 and T014 can run independently after dependencies met

### Phase 3: Integration (Day 4)
T015 → T016 (complex integration) → T017-T020 (polish and consistency)

**Critical Path:** T015 → T016 → T017 → T019 → T020
**Parallel Options:** T018 can run with T017

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Day 5)
T021 (error handling) → T022-T027 (advanced capabilities)

**Critical Path:** T021 → T022 → T023 → T024 → T025
**Parallel Options:** T026 and T027 can run after their dependencies

## Current Status

### Current Focus: Phase 2 - Core Command Logic
**Next Task:** T009 - Create prd-to-tasks.md command with $ARGUMENTS
**Dependencies Satisfied:** Yes (Phase 1 complete, T008 dependency met)
**Estimated Completion:** Day 2-3

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Format Strategy:** Enhanced markdown with embedded metadata
2. **Command Architecture:** Two complementary commands with auto-integration
3. **AI Approach:** Use Claude Code's built-in capabilities only
4. **Metadata Embedding:** Human-readable format with parsing capability

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk:** Complex metadata parsing → **Mitigation:** Simple, structured format
- **Risk:** Command integration complexity → **Mitigation:** Clear interfaces and validation
- **Risk:** AI analysis quality → **Mitigation:** Structured prompts and examples
