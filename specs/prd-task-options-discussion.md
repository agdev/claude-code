# PRD to Tasks Implementation Options Discussion

## Problem Statement

During the implementation of custom Claude Code slash commands for PRD-to-task conversion, we discovered a critical limitation: **Claude Code slash commands cannot call or execute other slash commands**. This breaks our intended architecture where `prd-to-tasks` would automatically call `task-breakdown` for complex tasks.

### Current Implementation Issues

1. **Non-functional Integration**: The `prd-to-tasks.md` command references calling `/project:task-breakdown` but this is not possible
2. **False Promises**: Documentation suggests automatic integration that cannot be delivered
3. **Incomplete Workflow**: Complex tasks are marked for breakdown but no mechanism exists to perform it
4. **User Confusion**: Commands appear to work together but don't actually integrate

## Solution Options Analysis

### Option A: Self-Contained Commands with Merged Logic

**Approach**: Incorporate task breakdown logic directly into the `prd-to-tasks` command.

#### Implementation
- **prd-to-tasks**: Include full breakdown functionality for tasks with complexity > 6
- **task-breakdown**: Remains as standalone manual tool
- **Integration**: No command-to-command calls, all logic in one place

#### Pros
- ✅ **Fully Functional**: No integration issues, works as expected
- ✅ **Seamless UX**: User runs one command and gets complete breakdown
- ✅ **Reliable**: No dependencies on command integration mechanisms
- ✅ **Complete**: Delivers all promised functionality

#### Cons
- ❌ **Code Duplication**: Breakdown logic exists in both commands
- ❌ **Maintenance**: Changes need to be made in multiple places
- ❌ **Command Bloat**: prd-to-tasks becomes very large and complex
- ❌ **Single Responsibility**: Commands do multiple things

#### Technical Details
```markdown
# In prd-to-tasks.md
## Step 6: Complex Task Breakdown
For tasks with complexity > 6:
1. Apply breakdown strategies (technical-domain, user-journey, etc.)
2. Generate 4-8 subtasks with T###.# IDs
3. Create detailed subtask analysis
4. Integrate subtasks into main TASKS.md output
5. Update dependencies to reference subtasks
```

### Option B: Manual Workflow with Clear Instructions

**Approach**: Keep commands separate and create clear workflow documentation.

#### Implementation
- **prd-to-tasks**: Generate main task list, mark complex tasks with ⚡ indicator
- **task-breakdown**: User manually runs on complex tasks
- **Documentation**: Clear step-by-step workflow instructions

#### Pros
- ✅ **Clean Separation**: Each command has single responsibility
- ✅ **No Duplication**: Breakdown logic exists only in task-breakdown
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Easy to update and modify individual commands
- ✅ **Flexible**: User can choose which tasks to break down

#### Cons
- ❌ **Manual Steps**: User must identify and breakdown complex tasks manually
- ❌ **Workflow Complexity**: Multiple commands required for complete workflow
- ❌ **Potential Errors**: User might miss complex tasks or forget to break them down
- ❌ **Less Automation**: Doesn't deliver the promised automatic breakdown

#### Technical Details
```markdown
# Workflow Documentation
1. Run: /project:prd-to-tasks ./requirements.md ./output
2. Review generated TASKS.md for tasks marked with ⚡
3. For each complex task: /project:task-breakdown ./output/task-{id}.md ./output
4. Manually merge breakdown results into main TASKS.md
```

### Option C: Single Combined Command

**Approach**: Create one comprehensive command that handles both PRD analysis and task breakdown.

#### Implementation
- **prd-to-tasks-complete**: Single command with comprehensive functionality
- **Remove**: Separate task-breakdown command
- **Workflow**: One command execution produces complete results

#### Pros
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Single command for entire workflow
- ✅ **Complete Automation**: No manual steps required
- ✅ **Consistent Output**: All generated by same logic and formatting
- ✅ **Easy to Use**: Simple one-step process for users

#### Cons
- ❌ **Command Complexity**: Very large and complex single command
- ❌ **Inflexibility**: Cannot break down individual tasks separately
- ❌ **Maintenance Challenge**: All logic in one place makes updates difficult
- ❌ **Testing Complexity**: Harder to test individual components

#### Technical Details
```markdown
# prd-to-tasks-complete.md
- PRD analysis and initial task generation
- Automatic complexity assessment
- Inline breakdown for complex tasks
- Comprehensive output with subtasks
- Dependency management across all levels
```

### Option D: Custom MCP Server Approach (Recommended)

**Approach**: Create a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides task management tools.

#### Implementation
- **MCP Server**: Node.js + TypeScript server with task management tools
- **Tools**: `analyze_prd`, `breakdown_task`, `validate_dependencies`, etc.
- **Integration**: Native Claude Code integration via MCP protocol
- **AI**: Uses Claude Code's built-in AI capabilities (no external APIs)

#### Pros
- ✅ **Native Integration**: Works seamlessly within Claude Code ecosystem
- ✅ **Tool Composition**: Tools can naturally orchestrate together
- ✅ **Rich Interface**: Resources, prompts, and tools available
- ✅ **Persistent State**: Can maintain project context across sessions
- ✅ **Professional Solution**: Similar to claude-task-master but integrated
- ✅ **Extensible**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities
- ✅ **No External Dependencies**: Uses Claude Code's AI only

#### Cons
- ❌ **Development Complexity**: Requires Node.js/TypeScript development
- ❌ **Setup Overhead**: Users need to install and configure MCP server
- ❌ **Maintenance**: Additional codebase to maintain
- ❌ **Learning Curve**: Users need to understand MCP tools vs slash commands

#### Technical Details
```typescript
// MCP Server Structure
server.registerTool("analyze_prd", {
  title: "PRD Analysis and Task Generation",
  inputSchema: {
    prdPath: z.string(),
    outputPath: z.string()
  }
}, async ({ prdPath, outputPath }) => {
  // Use Claude Code's AI for analysis
  // Generate enhanced markdown output
  // Return structured results
});

server.registerTool("breakdown_task", {
  title: "Complex Task Breakdown", 
  inputSchema: {
    taskId: z.string(),
    projectPath: z.string()
  }
}, async ({ taskId, projectPath }) => {
  // Break down specific task into subtasks
  // Update main task list
  // Generate individual task files
});
```
