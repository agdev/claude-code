================================================================================
                         IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS
================================================================================

✓ 3-Step Linear Workflow
  greeting → user_input → generate_jokes

✓ Function-Based Actions
  - @action decorator with reads/writes
  - Sync actions: greeting, user_input
  - Async action: generate_jokes (with internal parallelism)

✓ Internal Parallelism (Option A)
  - asyncio.gather() for 3 parallel joke generations
  - Simple, clear, Pythonic async pattern

✓ MongoDB Persistence
  - URI: mongodb://localhost:27017
  - Database: burr-flow-poc
  - Auto-save after each action

✓ Local Tracking
  - Project: joke-generator
  - UI: http://localhost:7241
  - UUID-based identifiers

✓ Immutable State Patterns
  - All actions use state.update()
  - Predictable, functional approach

✓ Complete Type Safety
  - Type hints throughout
  - TypedDict for state schema

✓ Comprehensive Documentation
  - 4 detailed guides
  - Visual diagrams
  - Usage examples
  - Test scaffolding

================================================================================
                              QUICK START
================================================================================

1. Install Dependencies:
   cd burr-flow
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Start MongoDB:
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name burr-mongodb mongo:latest

3. Run Demo:
   python main.py

4. View Tracking UI:
   open http://localhost:7241

================================================================================
                           NEXT DEVELOPMENT STEPS
================================================================================

Priority 1 - Core Implementation:
  [ ] Implement LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic)
  [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
  [ ] Enhance greeting with personalization

Priority 2 - Production Readiness:
  [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic
  [ ] Write comprehensive tests (90%+ coverage)
  [ ] Add caching and rate limiting

Priority 3 - Integration:
  [ ] Create FastAPI REST endpoints
  [ ] Add WebSocket streaming support
  [ ] Containerize and deploy

================================================================================
                              KEY PATTERNS
================================================================================

Burr ApplicationBuilder:
  app = (
      ApplicationBuilder()
      .with_actions(action1=action1, action2=action2)
      .with_transitions(("action1", "action2"))
      .with_state_persister(persister)
      .with_tracker(tracker)
      .with_identifiers(app_id=uuid, partition_key=uuid)
      .build()
  )

Action Decorator:
  @action(reads=["field1"], writes=["field2"])
  async def my_action(state: State, param: str) -> State:
      value = state["field1"]
      result = await process(value, param)
      return state.update(field2=result)

Async Execution:
  action, result, state = await app.arun(
      halt_after=["action_name"],
      inputs={"param": "value"}
  )

================================================================================
                          DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOLLOWED
================================================================================

✓ Simplicity First       - No over-engineering, clear structure
✓ Type Safety            - Complete type hints throughout
✓ Observability          - Tracking enabled from day one
✓ Persistence            - Session continuity with MongoDB
✓ Async-First            - Efficient I/O with asyncio
✓ Testability            - Stub implementations ready for testing
✓ Documentation          - Comprehensive guides and examples
✓ Pythonic Patterns      - Idiomatic Python 3.12+ code

================================================================================
                               STATUS: READY
================================================================================

All specifications met. Clean scaffolding with proper Burr framework patterns.
All actions are stubs with TODO comments for future implementation.
Complete documentation and testing framework in place.

Ready for LLM integration and production development!
